                                    <p>Timothy Walter Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, USA.
                                        As a child, Burton was drawn to drawing and animation, inspired by classic horror films and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1074100.1074637">ARPANET</a> and packet switching, developed in the late 1960s, set the stage for what we now call the Internet.

                                    <p>Looking forward, the Internet will keep changing. We might see things like real-time transport, Internet phones, and Internet TV. With devices getting smaller and more portable, we'll be able to use the Internet wherever we go. The challenge is to manage these changes well to keep up with what people need and the new technology.<br>In summary, the Internet has come a long way from a big idea in the 1960s to something we all use today. The future will bring even more changes, making the Internet a powerful force in our digital world.</p>

                                    <h2 id="Intro">Introduction to HTTP</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP helps systems on the Web communicate. It's a protocol that enables data exchange, allowing clients (like web browsers) to request information from servers and receive responses. HTTP is crucial for the World Wide Web.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Basic">Basics of HTTP</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP works as a request-response system, where a client starts communication by sending a request to a server, which then responds. Importantly, HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and not influenced by previous ones.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Structure">Structure of an HTTP Transaction</h2>
                                    <p>An HTTP transaction involves a client's request and a server's response. The client starts by sending an HTTP request to a specific URL, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Requests">HTTP Requests</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP requests include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Indicates the desired action (e.g. GET, POST).</li>
                                        <li><strong>URL:</strong> Identifies the resource.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Headers:</strong> Provide additional information about the request. GET requests retrieve data, while POST requests submit data to be processed by the server. Other methods include PUT (update) and DELETE (remove).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h2 id="Response">HTTP Responses</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP responses include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Status Code:</strong> A three-digit code indicating the result of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Headers:</strong> Additional information about the response.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Message Body:</strong> The actual data, such as HTML content or images</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2 id="Headers">HTTP Headers</h2>
                                    <p>Headers accompany both requests and responses, providing metadata about the message. Common headers include Content-Type (describing the type of data) and User-Agent (identifying the client making the request). Headers enhance understanding and aid in proper communication.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Connect">Connection Management</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP supports both persistent and non-persistent connections. In a persistent connection, multiple requests and responses can occur over a single connection, reducing latency and improving efficiency.</p>
                                    <h2 id="HM">HTTP Methods</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP methods define the action to be performed. Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update a resource), and DELETE (remove a resource). Different methods serve different purposes in interacting with resources on the server.</p>
                                    <h2 id="SC">Status Codes</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP status codes communicate the outcome of a request. Examples include 200 OK (successful request), 404 Not Found (requested resource not found), and 500 Internal Server Error (server encountered an error). Status codes aid in troubleshooting and understanding the success or failure of a request.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Cookies">Cookies</h2>
                                    <p>Cookies store information on the client's machine, allowing servers to track and manage user sessions. They provide a way to maintain state across multiple requests.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Security">Security Considerations</h2>
                                    <p>Security is crucial in web communication. <a href="https://eds-s-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.griffith.ie/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&sid=faf05ff4-858a-4f90-91c5-ec835401a592%40redis">HTTPS</a> (HTTP Secure) encrypts data during transmission, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. It protects against data interception and tampering.</p>
                                    <h2 id="Evolution">Evolution of HTTP</h2>
                                    <p>HTTP/1.1 is widely used, but ongoing efforts focus on improving performance. HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing and header compression, while HTTP/3 aims for enhanced speed and efficiency. This summary provides a condensed version of the comprehensive "HTTP Overview" document available on MDN. For detailed explanations, examples, and additional information, it is recommended to refer to the MDN HTTP Overview.</p>

                                <p>In conclusion, getting web pages to your browser relies on a thing called Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. It's like a messenger that helps your computer talk to other computers on the internet. When you open a website, your computer asks for information using an HTTP request, and the website's computer responds with the info.</p>
                                <p>HTTP works in a way where each question and answer is separate and doesn't remember what was said before – kind of like short conversations. The requests include what action to take, like asking for a page or sending some information. The responses come with a status (like saying things went well or there's an issue), extra info, and the actual stuff you see on the webpage.</p>
                                <p>Headers are like tags that add extra info to these messages, helping them understand each other better. There are smart ways (like keeping the chat going for a bit) to make this process quicker. Security is important, too, with a secure version called HTTPS to protect the info being sent.</p>
                                <p>This whole system is always improving (like going from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 and HTTP/3), making sure your internet experience is faster and safer.</p>
